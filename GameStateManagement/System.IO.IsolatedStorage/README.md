System.IO.IsolatedStorage
================

This is a minimal implementation of Isolated Storage that is useful for porting games to Windows 8 apps, where Isolated Storage is not natively supported.  There is some missing functionality, and submits to add the missing functionality are welcome.

It requires a reference to MonoGame as the System.IO.FileMode enumeration is declared in MonoGame.
